Why should you make your own R packages?

**Reproducible research!**

An R package is the **basic unit of reusable code**.
If you want to reuse code later or want others to be able to use your code, you should put it in a package.

### Making your first R package

In this lesson, we will start building a "[personal package][PP]". This is meant to
collect any kind of R code that is useful to _you_. As you continue to evolve it
after this lesson, you may move codes that belong to the same publication, topic
or a distinct project, into their own packages. Here we begin to realise the
benefit of already documenting the functions formally earlier: 
We can publish more quickly, because we didn't leave much unfished clean-up business.

[PP]: https://hilaryparker.com/2013/04/03/personal-r-packages/

To start working on this personal package, please open RStudio's `File` menu and 
select `New Project… > New Directory… > R Package`. Give it a unique, but useful
name. Your own will work just fine. Bonus points for squeezing in an `R` ;-)

Also add the `source files` we created earlier (the first versions of `center.R`
and `rescale.R`), so that we have some example code right away.

In case you have learned about version control already, it would be a good 
practice to `create a git repository` now and `git commit` each step of
building this package.

<img src="../fig/08-RStudio-new-package-git.png" alt="Default package files in RStudio's Git pane" width="500" />

RStudio's "skeleton" package can already be built, using the `Build > Install and Restart`
option. Note the `library(...)` line that appears in the console. 
Also, notice there is now a `package:YouRName` environment that is the parent 
environment to the global environment.


~~~
search()
~~~
{: .language-r}

This means you can now take
advantage of the console's auto-complete just like for any other package. Type
`cen` and/or `resc`, then `TAB` and test some examples like `center(c(1, 2, 3))` or 
`rescale(c(1, 2, 3))`.

## Folder and file structure of an R package

An R package requires four components:

*   a `DESCRIPTION` file with metadata about the package
*   an `R` directory with the code
*   a `man` directory with documentation (we will create this automatically)
*   a `NAMESPACE` file listing user-level ("exported") functions in the package (we will also create this automatically)

*There are other optional components. [Read the "R packages" book][r-pkgs-desc] and/or the original ["Writing R Extensions" documentation][WRE] for much more information.*

[r-pkgs-desc]: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html
[WRE]: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Package-structure

### .R files

Functions don't all have to be in one file or each in separate files.
How you organize them is up to you.
Suggestion: organize in a logical manner so that you know which file holds which functions.

### `DESCRIPTION` file

~~~
Package: PackageName
Type: Package
Title: What the Package Does (Title Case)
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Who wrote it
Maintainer: The package maintainer <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: More about what it does (maybe more than one line)
    Use four spaces when indenting paragraphs within the Description.
License: What license is it under?
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
~~~
{: .source}

The package name can only contain letters and numbers and has to start with a letter.

### Converting function documentation to help pages

Remember that we documented our functions with roxygen comments?
Let's try and look it up:


~~~
?center
help(rescale)
~~~
{: .language-r}

> ## Why `No documentation for '…' in specified packages and libraries`? We did write it!
>
> Why do you think the documentation of our package can not be found. Hint: Look
> at the commit diff.
> >
> > ## Solution
> > 
> > We did not yet tell R to actually generate the `man`ual files and folders in
> > our package. This needs to be done with `roxygen2::roxygenise()`
> > 
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

After `Install and Restart`-ing again, looking up the documentation should work.

What exactly does `roxygen2` do? It reads lines that begin with `#'` as the function documentation for your package.
Descriptive tags are preceded with the `@` symbol. For example, `@param` has information about the input parameters for the function.

### Exporting "user-level" function

We haven't talked about the `NAMESPACE` file yet! It belongs to the package skeleton,
and was set up by RStudio with an `exportPattern`. Any file name in `R/` that
matches it is automatically exported, meaning offered to users of your package
in the console's tab-completion.

In case you want to publish your package and keep some functions hidden (maybe
because they only do auxiliary tasks), you should delete this default file, tag
the functions you _do want to expose_ with `@export` and rerun `roxygenise()`.

Learn more about this from the ["R packages" book][r-pkgs-name].

[r-pkgs-name]: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/namespace.html


### Finishing up

Please take a look at RStudio's `Files` panes now. The `/man` directory should
now contain one LaTeX-like formatted `.Rd` file for each function.

In case you learned about Git already, also view the `.Rd` files in RStudio's
`Git` pane and commit the documentation.

> ## How would you word the commit message?
>
> "Add docu" is a bit moot, because that's obvious from the filenames and contents.
> Which other messages would better explain the "Why?", or that would be more useful
> when browsing the commit history later?
> >
> > ## Hints
> > 
> > - "roxygenise() function comments into help pages" because it mentions the 
> >    package and command you used
> > - "Integrate function docu into R's standard help pages"
> > - "Render function docu as R's standard help pages"
> > 
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

Also, after `roxygenise()`-ing the function docu, you can tell R to run the examples.
Using R's `example()` function on another function's name saves you from
scrolling down its help page, copying the example code and pasting it into the
console.

This was our basic introduction to packaging up R functions. To go on from here,
remember to functionalise R code that you use repeatedly and incorporate it into
your personal package. A good resource to find more guidance on packaging R code
is [ROpenSci's onboarding guide][ROSPG].
