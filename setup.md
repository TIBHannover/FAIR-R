This lesson assumes you have the [R software](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) and the [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) installed on your computer.

You also need to download a dataset to follow this lesson:

1. Make a new folder on your `Desktop/` called `FAIR-R`.
1. Download [inflammation.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TIBHannover/FAIR-R/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/inflammation.csv) to that folder. If your browser shows the file content, press `CTRL`+`S`.
4. You can access this folder from the Unix shell with:

~~~
$ cd
$ cd Desktop/FAIR-R
~~~
{: .bash}
